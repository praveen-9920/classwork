<b> I ask them to take a poem
    and hold it up to the light
    like a color slide</b>
                  
<em>press an ear against its hive.</em>
                
<u> I say drop a mouse into a poem
    and watch him probe his way out,
    or walk inside the poem's room
    and feel the walls for a light switch.</u>
                  
<big>I want them to waterski
     across the surface of a poem
     waving at the author's name on the shore.</big>
                 
<small>But all they want to do
       is tie the poem to a chair with rope
       and torture a confession out of it.</small>
                    
<strike>They begin beating it with a hose
        to find out what it really means.</strike>
