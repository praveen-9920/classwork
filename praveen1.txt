HTML5 is a HyperText Markup Language.
That can be used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
HTML5 is easy to implement and it works with CSS3. Today all browsers support 
HTML5 tags and even IE6 understands the markup <!doctype html> and will render the pages correctly.
HTML5 has come along with clean markup and clean code that make it more accessible than the previous version.
